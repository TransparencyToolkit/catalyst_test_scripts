document_topic: Likely requires manual tagging to be accurate, but could
approximate with a normalized term list. Or could include manual fields if the
RSS feedd categories is added to the dataspec.

sigads: Just a regex. Should be possible to duplicate.

codewords: A fancy normalized term list. Won't be as accurate but should be
able to mostly duplicate.

agency: Manually tagged, but could automate by including the RSS feed
categories or roughly approximate by extracting from text.

countries_mentioned: A normal term list. Can be duplicated exactly.

overall_classification: Can try to detect with a regex.

overall_relto: This could be handled in two steps. First, extracting the
classification header with a regex. Second, using a termlist to extract the
3-letter country codes.

description: Needs to be manually added.

Then there are a number of new fields that could be added, such as extracted
entities or keywords. Another way to duplicate the manual fields may be to
first use entity extraction to get all organizations, and then run a term list
on that field with a list of intelligence agencies.
